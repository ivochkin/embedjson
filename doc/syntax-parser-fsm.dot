/*
 * Embedjson syntax parser Pushdown Automaton [1] transitions diagram.
 *
 * Label syntax " {, push { " means "If input symbol is {, then
 * push { onto the stack and follow this transition".
 *
 * Label syntax " ], pop [, { " means "If input symbol is ], then
 * ensure that top element of the stack is [, pop it, and if the
 * pop element of the stack is now { follow this transition".
 *
 * Transition induced by the "primitive" symbol are ones that
 * are made when one of the following tokens is encountered:
 * - string
 * - number
 * - true
 * - false
 * - null
